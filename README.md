# SetDB

A Letterboxd-style web application for tracking and discovering DJ sets.

## What is SetDB?

SetDB is a passion project born from my love of DJing and electronic music. Just like Letterboxd helps film lovers track and review movies, SetDB helps music enthusiasts track, rate, and review DJ sets.

Whether you're discovering sets on YouTube, SoundCloud, or experiencing them live at festivals and clubs, Deckd lets you:
- **Log sets** you've listened to or seen live
- **Rate them** with half-star precision (0.5 to 5.0 stars)
- **Write reviews** to share your thoughts
- **Create lists** to organize your favorites
- **Follow other users** to discover new music
- **Import sets** directly from YouTube and SoundCloud

## Why This Project?

DJing has been a passion of mine for years, and I've always wanted a better way to track the incredible sets I discover. This project combines my love for music with my interest in building full-stack applications. It's a learning experience and a tool I hope other music lovers will find useful.
